## Problem
>Its really hard to keep track of important things while you surf the internet. Important this can passby without you even noticing.

## :star_struck: Worry not, :spiral_notepad: Scribble.It is here!!
We have created a google chrome extension that takes care of your notes and related images and links. It is a google chrome extension built primarily for students to make their development journeys more exciting. It's open source and allows students to customize it their way.

### :motorway: Track
**Education**
> Having a note taking tool is very handy in this era where all the things have been moved to web. Jotting down points or storing important images is necessary.

### :bulb: Inspiration
We have tried numerous note taking chrome extensions but they missed an important feature of allowing the user to store images along with the notes. After a bit of research we tried to come p with our own extension.
